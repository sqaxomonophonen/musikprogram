Graph editor actions (TODO):

 - [Pan] - RMB+drag
 - [Go to parent]
 - [Insert node]
    - insert from standard library...
    - insert from local library...
    - insert from shortcuts...
    - text search...
 - [Delete node]
 - [Move node]
 - [Create connection between two node ports]
 - [Delete connection]
 - [Duplicate node]
 - [Edit internal/external node appearance] (internal is background pattern;
   external is node shape, colors, and maybe custom icon)
 - [Edit node properties] (not all nodes have properties, but some do: a
   sampler needs a PCM resource; a FIR resampler needs parameters to construct
   a FIR table; size, window function, window parameters, etc ... some
   parameter-like things might be handled with constant inputs, e.g. resampling
   factor, but making e.g. a PCM resource a constant input only moves the
   "property editor" problem elsewhere)
 - [Go from input to corresponding tracker column] or similar... highlighting
   may be fine






"Graph palette":

 - used for node insertions (things like PCM resources are possibly also
   "nodes")

 - fixed part of the graph viewport, not a "modal"; 3 modes: "hidden", "row",
   and "expanded"? "row" displays a single row of possible objects to insert;
   has an X-scrollbar if there are more objects than space. "expanded" allows
   you to resize the area and make it bigger, and a Y-scrollbar is shown
   instead (objects are "word wrapped"; each row shows as many objects as
   possible)

 - pressing [/] (keyboard focus in graph viewport) opens a search field.
   pressing [ENTER] chooses the first search result (or another, if using
   cursor keys) for insertion; graph viewport is temporarily in node insert
   mode where a ghost node is shown under the mouse cursor; [LMB] inserts it;
   [ESC] (/[RMB]?) cancels

 - there are possibly search prefixes for narrowing the search fast... e.g.
   typing "//math/add"; first [/] opens the search field; second [/] means
   "prefix search", so that "ma" doesn't match "xyzzy/aMAzingoscillator"

 - [/] should be as non-modal as possible; if the palette is in "hidden" mode,
   it is temporarily shown as "row" mode for the purpose of showing search
   results; also, it should be possible to find all resources this way; stdlib;
   personal library; project assets

 - possibly [?] ([SHIFT]+[/]) or [CTRL/ALT]+[/] have different meanings...
   whatever's easy to reach

 - in general; should be designed "keyboard-first", but allow a more mousey
   usage when appropriate

 - flat vs tree view? "math/add" can both be shown in a flat view, or below the
   "math" folder. possibly a toggle?

 - "super folders":
   - standard library; built-in atomics/macros
   - personal library; your own creations; lives in ~/.mprg/lib (or
     ~/.local/share/mprg)
   - shortcuts; limited number of quickhand objects, available using keyboard
     shortcuts (e.g. [SHIFT]+[0-9])
   - local project resources (probably PCMs)

DECIDE?
 - how are objects ADDED to personal library and shortcuts? I suppose you can
   drag from graph to palette, but it means something subtly different when the
   drop target is also the graph (move vs copy)... I suppose ctrl+c/v could
   work, but invisible keyboard focus is kind of awful (you click the palette
   area; nothing visible happens, but it is now the "receiver" of ctrl+v)...
   also, how do I communicate what path I want the new object to live under?
   e.g. /foo/bar/sawosc?
