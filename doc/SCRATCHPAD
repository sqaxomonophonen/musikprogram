Graph editor actions (TODO):

 - [Pan] - RMB+drag
 - [Go to parent]
 - [Insert node]
    - insert from standard library...
    - insert from local library...
    - insert from shortcuts...
    - text search...
 - [Delete node]
 - [Move node]
 - [Create connection between two node ports]
 - [Delete connection]
 - [Duplicate node]
 - [Edit internal/external node appearance] (internal is background pattern;
   external is node shape, colors, and maybe custom icon)
 - [Edit node properties] (not all nodes have properties, but some do: a
   sampler needs a PCM resource; a FIR resampler needs parameters to construct
   a FIR table; size, window function, window parameters, etc ... some
   parameter-like things might be handled with constant inputs, e.g. resampling
   factor, but making e.g. a PCM resource a constant input only moves the
   "property editor" problem elsewhere)
